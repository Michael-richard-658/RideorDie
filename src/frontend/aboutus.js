    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>RideOrDie</strong>, the ultimate platform for motorcycle enthusiasts to connect, explore, and share the love of riding. We believe in the power of the open road, the thrill of the ride, and the unforgettable memories made along the way. Whether you’re a solo rider seeking the freedom of the road or a social rider looking to bond over shared journeys, RideOrDie is designed to bring people together in their passion for motorcycles.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>At RideOrDie, our goal is to foster a strong, supportive community where motorcyclists of all levels—beginners, seasoned riders, and everyone in between—can find like-minded riders, discover new routes, and experience the joys of the ride together. We want every rider to feel safe, confident, and inspired as they explore the road ahead.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Ride Alone When You Can Ride With Others?</h2>
    <p>Riding alone brings freedom and solitude, but riding with a community creates shared experiences, stories, and friendships that last a lifetime. With RideOrDie, you can choose to explore on your own or find the perfect group of riders who share your interests. Join up with others for a variety of rides, from scenic cruises and breezy beach outings to adventurous mountain trails and challenging off-road paths.</p>

    <h3>Ride Types and Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solo Rides:</strong> Perfect for those looking to explore at their own pace. Discover new destinations and challenge yourself without the need to coordinate with a group.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Rides:</strong> Join others for group adventures that make riding safer and more enjoyable. Riding with a group not only adds to the fun but also increases safety by fostering camaraderie and teamwork on the road.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each ride is categorized by its unique character: <em>Adventure, Scenic, Breeze,</em> or <em>Off-Road</em>. This way, riders can find exactly what they’re looking for, whether it’s a calm ride through serene landscapes or an adrenaline-filled journey through rugged terrain.</p>
